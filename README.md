# Maze-Pursuit
Maze Pursuit is a C++ game developed using SFML. Navigate through randomly generated mazes, evade a chasing entity, and reach the exit to advance. The project demonstrates the use of graph-based data structures for maze generation, pathfinding algorithms, and efficient game state management.
