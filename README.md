# Maze Pursuit

## Overview

The "Maze Pursuit" project is an engaging and interactive game that combines maze traversal with pursuit mechanics. Developed as a semester project for the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course, it serves as a practical demonstration of applying theoretical concepts in a real-world context.

## Features

- **Maze Generation**: Utilizes algorithms like depth-first search (DFS) or Prim's algorithm to generate random maze layouts.
- **Player Control**: Allows players to navigate through the maze using keyboard or mouse controls.
- **Enemy AI**: Implements pursuit mechanics where enemies chase the player within the maze.
- **Scoring System**: Tracks player scores based on maze completion time and enemy avoidance.
- **Graphics**: Utilizes SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for rendering graphics and providing a visually appealing user interface.
- **Sound Effects**: Enhances user experience with immersive sound effects for player actions and enemy interactions.

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: Navigate through the maze while avoiding enemies.
2. **Controls**:
   - Use arrow keys or WASD keys to move the player character.
   - Alternatively, click on the screen to move the player using mouse controls.
3. **Gameplay**:
   - Navigate through the maze to reach the exit point.
   - Avoid collisions with enemy characters roaming the maze.
   - Collect power-ups or bonuses to gain advantages or increase scores.
4. **Scoring**:
   - Complete the maze in the shortest time possible to achieve higher scores.
   - Avoid enemy encounters to maintain a higher score multiplier.
5. **Winning**:
   - Reach the exit point of the maze to successfully complete the level.
   - Compare scores with friends or other players to compete for the top spot on the leaderboard.

## Development Environment

- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Graphics Library**: SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or any C++ IDE supporting SFML.
- **Dependencies**: SFML library (installation instructions available on SFML website).
